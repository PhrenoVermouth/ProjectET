Allele-tagging report
=====================
Processed 60417966 read alignments in total
Reads were unaligned and hence skipped: 0 (0.00%)
Reads were hard-clipped (CIGAR: H) and skipped: 0
27008016 reads were unassignable (44.70%)
16751729 reads were specific for genome 1 (27.73%)
16560482 reads were specific for genome 2 (27.41%)
45623 reads did not contain one of the expected bases at known SNP positions (0.08%)
97739 contained conflicting allele-specific SNPs (0.16%)


SNP coverage report
===================
SNP annotation file:	/home1/share/snpsplit/PWK_Phj_single_strain/all_SNPs_PWK_PhJ_GRCm38.txt.gz
SNPs stored in total:	20315523
N-containing reads:	33412070
non-N:			26962393
total:			60417966
Reads had a deletion of the N-masked position (and were thus called Conflicting):	43503 (0.07%)
Of which had multiple deletions of N-masked positions within the same read:	94 (0.00%)

Of valid N containing reads,
N was present in the list of known SNPs:	69984508 (99.97%)
N was not present in the list of SNPs:		17620 (0.03%)
