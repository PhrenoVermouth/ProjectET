Allele-tagging report
=====================
Processed 21302322 read alignments in total
Reads were unaligned and hence skipped: 0 (0.00%)
Reads were hard-clipped (CIGAR: H) and skipped: 0
9339236 reads were unassignable (43.84%)
6257112 reads were specific for genome 1 (29.37%)
5668349 reads were specific for genome 2 (26.61%)
13599 reads did not contain one of the expected bases at known SNP positions (0.06%)
37625 contained conflicting allele-specific SNPs (0.18%)


SNP coverage report
===================
SNP annotation file:	/home1/share/snpsplit/PWK_Phj_single_strain/all_SNPs_PWK_PhJ_GRCm38.txt.gz
SNPs stored in total:	20315523
N-containing reads:	11959348
non-N:			9325637
total:			21302322
Reads had a deletion of the N-masked position (and were thus called Conflicting):	17337 (0.08%)
Of which had multiple deletions of N-masked positions within the same read:	42 (0.00%)

Of valid N containing reads,
N was present in the list of known SNPs:	26121229 (99.98%)
N was not present in the list of SNPs:		6248 (0.02%)
