Allele-tagging report
=====================
Processed 60562918 read alignments in total
Reads were unaligned and hence skipped: 0 (0.00%)
Reads were hard-clipped (CIGAR: H) and skipped: 0
25931531 reads were unassignable (42.82%)
16644298 reads were specific for genome 1 (27.48%)
17878152 reads were specific for genome 2 (29.52%)
55907 reads did not contain one of the expected bases at known SNP positions (0.09%)
108937 contained conflicting allele-specific SNPs (0.18%)


SNP coverage report
===================
SNP annotation file:	/home1/share/snpsplit/PWK_Phj_single_strain/all_SNPs_PWK_PhJ_GRCm38.txt.gz
SNPs stored in total:	20315523
N-containing reads:	34643448
non-N:			25875624
total:			60562918
Reads had a deletion of the N-masked position (and were thus called Conflicting):	43846 (0.07%)
Of which had multiple deletions of N-masked positions within the same read:	89 (0.00%)

Of valid N containing reads,
N was present in the list of known SNPs:	73987832 (99.97%)
N was not present in the list of SNPs:		18871 (0.03%)
