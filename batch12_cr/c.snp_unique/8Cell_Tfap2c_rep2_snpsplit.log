Allele-tagging report
=====================
Processed 46946460 read alignments in total
Reads were unaligned and hence skipped: 0 (0.00%)
Reads were hard-clipped (CIGAR: H) and skipped: 0
20160042 reads were unassignable (42.94%)
13020441 reads were specific for genome 1 (27.73%)
13675711 reads were specific for genome 2 (29.13%)
42802 reads did not contain one of the expected bases at known SNP positions (0.09%)
90266 contained conflicting allele-specific SNPs (0.19%)


SNP coverage report
===================
SNP annotation file:	/home1/share/snpsplit/PWK_Phj_single_strain/all_SNPs_PWK_PhJ_GRCm38.txt.gz
SNPs stored in total:	20315523
N-containing reads:	26790704
non-N:			20117240
total:			46946460
Reads had a deletion of the N-masked position (and were thus called Conflicting):	38516 (0.08%)
Of which had multiple deletions of N-masked positions within the same read:	68 (0.00%)

Of valid N containing reads,
N was present in the list of known SNPs:	57155519 (99.97%)
N was not present in the list of SNPs:		14949 (0.03%)
