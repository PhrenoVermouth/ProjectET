Allele-tagging report
=====================
Processed 34909254 read alignments in total
Reads were unaligned and hence skipped: 0 (0.00%)
15533196 reads were unassignable (44.50%)
10237584 reads were specific for genome 1 (29.33%)
9076723 reads were specific for genome 2 (26.00%)
26493 reads did not contain one of the expected bases at known SNP positions (0.08%)
61751 contained conflicting allele-specific SNPs (0.18%)


SNP coverage report
===================
SNP annotation file:	/home1/share/snpsplit/PWK_Phj_single_strain/all_SNPs_PWK_PhJ_GRCm38.txt.gz
SNPs stored in total:	20315523
N-containing reads:	19376313
non-N:			15506703
total:			34909254
Reads had a deletion of the N-masked position (and were thus called Conflicting):	26238 (0.08%)
Of which had multiple deletions of N-masked positions within the same read:	57 (0.00%)

Of valid N containing reads,
N was present in the list of known SNPs:	41114342 (99.98%)
N was not present in the list of SNPs:		9936 (0.02%)
