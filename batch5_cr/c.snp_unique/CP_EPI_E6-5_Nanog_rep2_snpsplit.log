Allele-tagging report
=====================
Processed 23906790 read alignments in total
Reads were unaligned and hence skipped: 0 (0.00%)
10655038 reads were unassignable (44.57%)
6961579 reads were specific for genome 1 (29.12%)
6246458 reads were specific for genome 2 (26.13%)
17747 reads did not contain one of the expected bases at known SNP positions (0.07%)
43715 contained conflicting allele-specific SNPs (0.18%)


SNP coverage report
===================
SNP annotation file:	/home1/share/snpsplit/PWK_Phj_single_strain/all_SNPs_PWK_PhJ_GRCm38.txt.gz
SNPs stored in total:	20315523
N-containing reads:	13249389
non-N:			10637291
total:			23906790
Reads had a deletion of the N-masked position (and were thus called Conflicting):	20110 (0.08%)
Of which had multiple deletions of N-masked positions within the same read:	34 (0.00%)

Of valid N containing reads,
N was present in the list of known SNPs:	28092117 (99.98%)
N was not present in the list of SNPs:		7011 (0.02%)
