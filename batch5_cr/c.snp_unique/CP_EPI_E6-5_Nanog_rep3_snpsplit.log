Allele-tagging report
=====================
Processed 24202618 read alignments in total
Reads were unaligned and hence skipped: 0 (0.00%)
10939704 reads were unassignable (45.20%)
6958809 reads were specific for genome 1 (28.75%)
6261484 reads were specific for genome 2 (25.87%)
19039 reads did not contain one of the expected bases at known SNP positions (0.08%)
42621 contained conflicting allele-specific SNPs (0.18%)


SNP coverage report
===================
SNP annotation file:	/home1/share/snpsplit/PWK_Phj_single_strain/all_SNPs_PWK_PhJ_GRCm38.txt.gz
SNPs stored in total:	20315523
N-containing reads:	13263370
non-N:			10920665
total:			24202618
Reads had a deletion of the N-masked position (and were thus called Conflicting):	18583 (0.08%)
Of which had multiple deletions of N-masked positions within the same read:	24 (0.00%)

Of valid N containing reads,
N was present in the list of known SNPs:	27959720 (99.98%)
N was not present in the list of SNPs:		6652 (0.02%)
