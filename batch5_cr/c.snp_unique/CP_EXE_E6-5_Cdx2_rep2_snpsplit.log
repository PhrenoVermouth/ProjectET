Allele-tagging report
=====================
Processed 32297590 read alignments in total
Reads were unaligned and hence skipped: 0 (0.00%)
15001904 reads were unassignable (46.45%)
9517592 reads were specific for genome 1 (29.47%)
7695929 reads were specific for genome 2 (23.83%)
21658 reads did not contain one of the expected bases at known SNP positions (0.07%)
82165 contained conflicting allele-specific SNPs (0.25%)


SNP coverage report
===================
SNP annotation file:	/home1/share/snpsplit/PWK_Phj_single_strain/all_SNPs_PWK_PhJ_GRCm38.txt.gz
SNPs stored in total:	20315523
N-containing reads:	17292744
non-N:			14980246
total:			32297590
Reads had a deletion of the N-masked position (and were thus called Conflicting):	24600 (0.08%)
Of which had multiple deletions of N-masked positions within the same read:	30 (0.00%)

Of valid N containing reads,
N was present in the list of known SNPs:	35941624 (99.98%)
N was not present in the list of SNPs:		8147 (0.02%)
