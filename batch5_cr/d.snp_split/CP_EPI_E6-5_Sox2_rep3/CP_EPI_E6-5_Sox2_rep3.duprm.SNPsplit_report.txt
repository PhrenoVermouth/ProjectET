Allele-tagging report
=====================
Processed 29442278 read alignments in total
Reads were unaligned and hence skipped: 0 (0.00%)
12937089 reads were unassignable (43.94%)
8748206 reads were specific for genome 1 (29.71%)
7699701 reads were specific for genome 2 (26.15%)
24494 reads did not contain one of the expected bases at known SNP positions (0.08%)
57282 contained conflicting allele-specific SNPs (0.19%)


SNP coverage report
===================
SNP annotation file:	/home1/share/snpsplit/PWK_Phj_single_strain/all_SNPs_PWK_PhJ_GRCm38.txt.gz
SNPs stored in total:	20315523
N-containing reads:	16505718
non-N:			12912595
total:			29442278
Reads had a deletion of the N-masked position (and were thus dropped):	23965 (0.08%)
Of which had multiple deletions of N-masked positions within the same read:	34

Of valid N containing reads,
N was present in the list of known SNPs:	35386013 (99.98%)
N was not present in the list of SNPs:		8700 (0.02%)
