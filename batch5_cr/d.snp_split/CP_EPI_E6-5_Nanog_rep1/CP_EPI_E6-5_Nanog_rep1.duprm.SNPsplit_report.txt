Allele-tagging report
=====================
Processed 27948840 read alignments in total
Reads were unaligned and hence skipped: 0 (0.00%)
12607962 reads were unassignable (45.11%)
8105406 reads were specific for genome 1 (29.00%)
7188495 reads were specific for genome 2 (25.72%)
17566 reads did not contain one of the expected bases at known SNP positions (0.06%)
46977 contained conflicting allele-specific SNPs (0.17%)


SNP coverage report
===================
SNP annotation file:	/home1/share/snpsplit/PWK_Phj_single_strain/all_SNPs_PWK_PhJ_GRCm38.txt.gz
SNPs stored in total:	20315523
N-containing reads:	15335996
non-N:			12590396
total:			27948840
Reads had a deletion of the N-masked position (and were thus dropped):	22448 (0.08%)
Of which had multiple deletions of N-masked positions within the same read:	47

Of valid N containing reads,
N was present in the list of known SNPs:	32288207 (99.98%)
N was not present in the list of SNPs:		7837 (0.02%)
