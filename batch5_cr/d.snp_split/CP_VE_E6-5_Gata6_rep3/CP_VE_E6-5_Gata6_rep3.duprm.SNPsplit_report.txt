Allele-tagging report
=====================
Processed 30243098 read alignments in total
Reads were unaligned and hence skipped: 0 (0.00%)
13276795 reads were unassignable (43.90%)
8927299 reads were specific for genome 1 (29.52%)
7981762 reads were specific for genome 2 (26.39%)
24649 reads did not contain one of the expected bases at known SNP positions (0.08%)
57242 contained conflicting allele-specific SNPs (0.19%)


SNP coverage report
===================
SNP annotation file:	/home1/share/snpsplit/PWK_Phj_single_strain/all_SNPs_PWK_PhJ_GRCm38.txt.gz
SNPs stored in total:	20315523
N-containing reads:	16967513
non-N:			13252146
total:			30243098
Reads had a deletion of the N-masked position (and were thus dropped):	23439 (0.08%)
Of which had multiple deletions of N-masked positions within the same read:	43

Of valid N containing reads,
N was present in the list of known SNPs:	36228800 (99.98%)
N was not present in the list of SNPs:		8123 (0.02%)
