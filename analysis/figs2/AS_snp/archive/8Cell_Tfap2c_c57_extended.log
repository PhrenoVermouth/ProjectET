	Using actual sizes of regions (-size given)
	Fragment size set to given
	Using 5 CPUs
	Will find motif(s) in /home1/gyang/work_space/4.ProjectET/analysis/motif_denovo/Tfap2c.motif
	Found mset for "mouse", will check against vertebrates motifs
	Peak/BED file conversion summary:
		BED/Header formatted lines: 403
		peakfile formatted lines: 0

	Peak File Statistics:
		Total Peaks: 692
		Redundant Peak IDs: 0
		Peaks lacking information: 0 (need at least 5 columns per peak)
		Peaks with misformatted coordinates: 0 (should be integer)
		Peaks with misformatted strand: 0 (should be either +/- or 0/1)

	Peak file looks good!

	Background fragment size set to 3207 (avg size of targets)
	Could not find background files for 3207 bp fragments
	Below are the sizes that are already available prepared.
