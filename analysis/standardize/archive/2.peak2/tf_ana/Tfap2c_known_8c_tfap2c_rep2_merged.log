	Using actual sizes of regions (-size given)
	Fragment size set to given
	Using 15 CPUs
	Will find motif(s) in /home1/homer/motifs/ap2gamma.motif
	Found mset for "mouse", will check against vertebrates motifs
	Peak/BED file conversion summary:
		BED/Header formatted lines: 54022
		peakfile formatted lines: 0

	Peak File Statistics:
		Total Peaks: 54022
		Redundant Peak IDs: 0
		Peaks lacking information: 0 (need at least 5 columns per peak)
		Peaks with misformatted coordinates: 0 (should be integer)
		Peaks with misformatted strand: 0 (should be either +/- or 0/1)

	Peak file looks good!

	Background fragment size set to 1332 (avg size of targets)
	Background files for 1332 bp fragments found.
