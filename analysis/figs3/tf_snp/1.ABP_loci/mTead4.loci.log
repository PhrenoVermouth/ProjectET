	Will find motif(s) in /home1/gyang/work_space/4.ProjectET/analysis/motif_denovo/Tead4.motif
	Found mset for "mouse", will check against vertebrates motifs
	Peak/BED file conversion summary:
		BED/Header formatted lines: 2294
		peakfile formatted lines: 0

	Peak File Statistics:
		Total Peaks: 2294
		Redundant Peak IDs: 0
		Peaks lacking information: 0 (need at least 5 columns per peak)
		Peaks with misformatted coordinates: 0 (should be integer)
		Peaks with misformatted strand: 0 (should be either +/- or 0/1)

	Peak file looks good!

	Background fragment size set to 999 (avg size of targets)
	Background files for 999 bp fragments found.
